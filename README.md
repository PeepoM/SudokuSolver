# Sudoku solver

## About
Sudoku solver is a program, that can be used to generate a Sudoku puzzle of an arbitrary difficulty. The program can also be utilized to remove numbers from the generated puzzle while making sure, it has still only one possible solution. A “solve” function is provided to solve an arbitrary (solvable) Sudoku board passed in by the user.

The program was created from my desire to learn more about backtracking, which is a depth-first search algorithm going hand in hand with recursion, and its applications to real-life problems.

The project as a whole uses Model-view-controller (MVC) design pattern, the point of which is to keep logic separate from the graphics, with controller working as a bridge between those two.
