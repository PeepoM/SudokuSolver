# SudokuSolver

## About
Sudoku Solver is a program, that can be used to generate a Sudoku puzzle of an arbitrary difficulty. The program can also be utilized to remove numbers from the generated puzzle while making sure, it has still only one possible solution. A “solve” function is provided to solve an arbitrary (solvable) Sudoku board passed in by the user.

The program was created from my desire to learn more about backtracking, which is a depth-first search algorithm going hand in hand with recursion, and its applications to real-life problems.
